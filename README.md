# heartattacks_classification

# Project Goal:
The Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset by RASHIK RAHMAN on Kaggle provides a vital dataset on medical information for patients with low and high chances of heart attack. By analyzing the learning algorithms, Decision Trees (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we can develop a predictive model that determines the best algorithm for this dataset. This project was inspired by TANAYA TIPRE's analysis on the same dataset, and can be found on Kaggle under Heart Attack Prediction - LR, SVM, KNN, DT.
